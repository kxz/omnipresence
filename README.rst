An IRC utility bot built on Twisted, originally developed for `the
#yackfest channel on EsperNet`__.
Most of its functionality is provided through plugins for commands and
channel-specific event handlers, with some sugar thrown in for flavor.
For full documentation, visit `Omnipresence's Read the Docs site`__,
or look inside the docs/ folder.
