An IRC utility bot built on Twisted, originally developed for [the
\#yackfest channel on EsperNet][yf].
Most of its functionality is provided through plugins for commands and
channel-specific event handlers, with some sugar thrown in for flavor.
For full documentation, visit [Omnipresence's Read the Docs site][rtd],
or look inside the docs/ folder.
