Omnipresence is an IRC utility bot built on Twisted.  Most of its functionality
is provided through plugins for commands and channel-specific event handlers,
with some other sugar thrown in for flavor.

To install Omnipresence, use "setup.py install" or easy_install.  Omnipresence
core depends on Twisted 8.2.0 or later, SQLObject, and httplib2.  Many plugins
have additional dependencies on BeautifulSoup, pytz, or PIL; see the provided
sample configuration file (docs/omnipresence.sample.cfg) for further details.

To run Omnipresence, use twistd:

  # Run twistd in the foreground and log to stdout:
  $ twistd -no omnipresence omnipresence.cfg

  # Daemonize twistd, logging to "messages" and using the PID file "pid":
  $ twistd -l messages --pidfile pid omnipresence omnipresence.cfg
