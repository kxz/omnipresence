Omnipresence documentation
==========================

Omnipresence is an IRC utility bot built on Twisted, originally developed for the `#yackfest channel on EsperNet <https://room208.org/yackfest/>`_.
Most of its functionality is provided through plugins for commands and channel-specific event handlers, with some other sugar thrown in for flavor.
